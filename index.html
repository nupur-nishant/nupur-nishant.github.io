        <h2 id="firstpost">First post: About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 19 year old Indian male student studying Civil Engineering in Indian Institute of Technology,Ropar(IIT-Rpr). I possess a hubmle following on Quora,of 4.1thousand as of now. So,you <em>might</em> know me of you're regular there. I go by the name I was chritened with,Nupur Nishant. I have a plenty of interests in science and other fields and I am here for the same. I am pretty aweful with computers and need to learn a lot, afterall I am a technology undergrad in 21st century.<br><br>If <strong>Pamela Fox</strong> ever reads this, I want to thank her for creating these extremely useful lessons. In college I got a 6 pointer in programming course, but thanks to her lessons on Khan Academy, I feel; nah, I am certain that one day I could become a top level programmer. </p>

       <h2 id="secondpost">Second post:AN</h2>
       <p> I have a brother, a younger brother whom we will call by his initials AN. He is 8 years and 265 days younger to me, 10 years old; 11 next month.<strong>He's learning programming too!</strong> I am convinced it wasn't easy to teach a 10 year old to code in JavaScript if there wasn't a good enough platform to learn from. He's completing his courses at a voracious spped. <em>He loves to code.</em>As I type this, he's angry with me for not sharing what little mobile data I have left as I need it to continue with my course. He wants to continue his,I feel ashamed and guilty but there is no cure: I third year IIT student needs to learn coding more urgently than a 6th standard student.Although being the one to instigated him to learn to code in the first place, it doesn't feel very good:(
